 * 96 lines of near-identical noise. It does NOT hold when the operator has to
 * supply different arr-side roots per branch (`/downloads/films` for movies,
 * `/downloads/series` for TV) — collapsing those to one row would silently
 * mis-map one of them.
 *
 * The seeded rows are a starting point, not a constraint: an operator whose arr
