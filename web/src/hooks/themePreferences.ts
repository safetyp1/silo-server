 *
 * Appearance settings are profile-scoped in the settings contract (`ui.text_scale`
 * lives at `profile`, with an optional `profile_device` override), and several
 * profiles on one account share a user id — so the owner token is the user id
 * plus the active profile id. Every cache read and write in the app resolves
 * its namespace through this function, so no call site can be left behind.
 *
 * On the profile picker (user signed in, no profile chosen) the owner is null,
 * which falls back to the last profile that wrote here — the same "keep the
 * last look" behavior as the login screen — and gates off the settings request,
 * which cannot resolve profile scope without an active profile anyway.
