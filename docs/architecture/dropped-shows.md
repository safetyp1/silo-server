# Dropped shows

A profile can drop a series to take it off its Next Up and Continue Watching rows
without touching its watch history. Drops sync both ways with watch providers that
support them: Trakt, Simkl, and watch-sync plugins that advertise `sync_dropped`.

## Local drops

`user_dropped_series` holds one row per profile and dropped series, with the time it was
dropped. A drop is **active** while no episode of the series has watch progress, or a
history-hide stamp (mark unwatched, remove from history), newer than `dropped_at`. So
watching any episode again undrops the series, whichever path recorded the watch, and no
writer needs to know about drops. Imported history keeps its original watch time, so
re-importing old plays never undrops a series. An inactive row means the same as no row;
watch sync removes it.

The rule reads `user_watch_progress` in PostgreSQL, so on deployments that keep watch
state in the SQLite user store a drop never ends by watching; it ends only when undone.

A v2 Home dismissal (`PUT /api/v2/home/dismissals/{surface}/{item_id}`) of an episode or
a series drops the series, from either surface. The frozen v1 route keeps per-card
dismissals.
Undoing the dismissal (`DELETE` on the same path) undrops it. Movies, audiobooks, and
ebooks keep per-item dismissals. Dismissing again refreshes `dropped_at`, which re-drops a
series the profile watched since.

## Where drops apply

- Next Up: global lookups (`ListNextUp` without a series) exclude active drops inside the
  anchor walk, so a dropped series neither shows nor spends the walk's series budget. This
  covers Home, Watch Tonight, section recipes, and jellycompat `/Shows/NextUp`. A lookup
  for one series (the series page, `/Shows/NextUp?SeriesId=`, Watch Together) still
  answers for it.
- Continue Watching: in-progress episodes of a dropped series are removed in the sections
  fetcher, the Continue Watching half of Watch Tonight, and the jellycompat Resume
  fallback.
- Raw progress and history reads are unaffected.

## Sync with providers

Each connection has one setting, `sync_dropped_enabled`. It is on for new connections,
and for existing connections that sync anything, so the first sync after the feature
ships imports drops already on the provider; a connection with every sync setting off
stays paused. A provider takes part when it advertises the `sync_dropped` capability.
Only v2 exposes the setting and capability; the frozen v1 responses omit them.

`watch_provider_dropped_items` records, per connection, the series Silo and the provider
last agreed are dropped. Each series is a three-way merge of the local drop, the remote
drop, and that agreed value; the side that moved wins. When the provider dropped a show
before the profile's latest watch of it in Silo, the show is undropped on the provider
instead of imported, because watching undrops. A drop that watching ended locally is restored when the provider's drop is newer than
that watch, since the user dropped the show again there. `remote_seen`, account scoping, the empty
read guard, and the rule that a series missing from a complete read counts as undropped
only when no row shares one of its ids all follow
[watch-provider-rating-sync.md](watch-provider-rating-sync.md). An incomplete read leaves
every series it omits unknown, and an explicit undrop tombstone undrops the series whose
agreed row or matched drop in the current read carries the same provider key.
Changes apply in read order per provider key, including when the read first introduces
the drop. A tombstone removes only its key; a surviving drop under another key keeps the
series dropped. When several keys remain, the later drop time wins.
A tombstone whose key names neither changes nothing: that is usually the provider
echoing an undrop whose agreement Silo already forgot. Local imports are compare-and-set on the row the run read, so a
concurrent dismissal or undo wins.

Provider reads can lag or omit Silo's writes. Trakt serves its GET responses from a cache
for up to an hour, and its dropped list leaves out drops that apps make, so a drop Silo
sends is usually never confirmed by a read. Such a drop stays agreed and is not sent
again; resending it would drop the show again each time the user undropped it on Trakt,
which Silo cannot see. An undrop of a drop a read had confirmed keeps its agreed row
until a read shows the show is gone, so a stale read resends the undrop instead of
importing the old drop back; an undrop of a drop no read confirmed forgets the row at
once. Both writes are idempotent.

Merges share the rating sync lock, so a connection reconciles ratings and drops one at a
time across nodes. Dismissing or undoing sends the change right away through a local
event, which waits for the lock and merges only the named series without reading the
provider. The scheduled sync runs the dropped phase first. It costs a request or two, so a large
history read that exhausts the provider's rate limit cannot starve it, and the order does
not change the merge: imported history keeps its original watch time, and providers
undrop a show that is watched.

## Providers

- Trakt: `GET /users/hidden/dropped` (every page, verified by a second read), and
  `POST /users/hidden/dropped` and `/users/hidden/dropped/remove`. Trakt's older hidden
  sections (`progress_watched`, `calendar`) are not drops and are not read. Trakt
  undrops a show itself when the user watches it.
- Simkl: `GET /sync/all-items/{shows,anime}/dropped`, skipped while the lists' `all`
  activity stamps are unchanged. Dropping moves a show to the `dropped` list with
  `POST /sync/add-to-list`; undropping moves it to `watching`. Simkl records no drop
  time, so an imported Simkl drop is stamped with the sync time.
- Watch-sync plugins: a plugin that sets `sync_dropped` (and lists `SERIES` in
  `supported_media_types`) answers `ListRemoteState` for the `DROPPED` state kind, with
  its cursor saved under `plugin.remote.dropped`. `complete_snapshot` means the rows are
  the account's full dropped set; otherwise the read is incremental and reports undrops
  as `removed` tombstones. `listed_at` is the drop time; without it an imported drop is
  stamped with the sync time. A complete snapshot with a row Silo cannot read (no
  identity, or media that is not a series) counts as incomplete, because that row may be
  a show that is still dropped. Drops and undrops are `MARK_DROPPED` and
  `UNMARK_DROPPED` events for `SERIES` media. Both are convergent, so the event ID
  carries the send time, and a `REJECTED` undrop is retried instead of being read as
  done.

Maintenance keeps both tables with their series: orphan cleanup treats them as
references, and catalog merges and splits move them. When a profile dropped both series
of a merge, the later drop wins, and a moved agreed row is reset to unconfirmed. Deleting
a profile deletes its drops on either user store backend.
