# Marker API

The v2 marker API reads effective file markers and updates manual markers. Each
operation applies the existing file, library, item, episode-parent, and extra-parent
access policy. Reads require authentication. Writes also require `marker_edit`
permission and pass the demo and viewer-access gates. Profile context remains
optional; supplying a profile applies its access restrictions. When any profile
on the account is PIN-protected or access-restricted, reads and writes without
`X-Profile-Id` are refused with `422 validation_failed` at
`header.x-profile-id`, so account scope cannot bypass those limits. API keys are
exempt.

## Provider modes and storage

New installations include TheIntroDB and default to online markers with local
detection as a fallback (`markers.mode=both`). Online markers are saved to the
library by default. The setup wizard offers separate controls for online lookup
and local detection before automatic lookup begins. New TV and mixed libraries
created in the web UI enable local detection by default; new movie libraries
leave it off, since movie credits are best effort. Existing library choices are
preserved. Local detection only runs in libraries where it is enabled.
Existing installations retain their configured marker mode, which accepts `off`,
`local`, `online`, and `both`.

`markers.online_storage` chooses how online results are used:

- `stored` persists markers and enables the **Sync online markers** task,
  scheduled daily at 03:00 in server-local time by default.
  Each run lists the due files once: unqueried files first, then the least
  recently fetched results, so a run stopped by a provider quota resumes where
  it left off. A run, including one that starts during a cooldown, waits out a
  cooldown of up to a minute that covers every provider and ends at a longer
  one. A metadata change makes a file due until a sync or lookup confirms its
  external IDs against every provider.
  For every provider, successful responses are fresh for 30 days and empty
  results are retried after 14 days, following TheIntroDB's guidance for
  clients that sync a library. Episodes that aired, and movies released, in the
  last 30 days or the coming week use 7 days and 1 day instead, while
  providers are still gaining markers for them.
  `markers.lazy_playback` also allows reads and playback to fill missing markers.
- `on_demand` looks up markers for the selected file and keeps a bounded,
  fifteen-minute memory cache. It does not persist provider responses or run
  background synchronization. Request leases, failures, and quota cooldowns are
  still shared through the database. Previously stored markers remain available.

Both paths honor provider priority, manual edits and deletions, and provider quota limits.

A manual deletion removes every occurrence of that kind for the selected file.
The empty range retains manual provenance: provider lookups, local detection,
rescans, and file-identity changes cannot restore it. An explicit manual set
adds the kind again. Other marker kinds are unchanged.

Manual writes require a Movie or Series library, including their mixed-library
variants. Unsupported library kinds return `422 validation_failed` without
changing markers, contributing them, or emitting a playback update.

Local detection finds episode intros and end credits, and movie end credits on
a best-effort basis: from chapters and the picture near the end, never intros.
Some movies get no local credits, or credits that start late. It never replaces
a marker from a higher-priority source, and it judges each kind separately, so
an episode with an online intro can still get local credits. With `on_demand`
storage, players keep the online intro while playback detects the credits.

`markers.detect_intros` and `markers.detect_credits` choose which kinds local
detection finds, server-wide. Each is `true` or `false`, independent of the
other, and defaults to `true`; a change applies without a restart. Credits
detection costs more, since it reads the end of each episode and movie. With
credits off, the **Detect markers on this server** task, playback detection,
and admin refresh skip episode credits and movies; with intros off, they skip
episode intros. Chapter markers of a kind that is off are skipped as well.
Turning a kind off keeps the markers already saved.
`detection_kind_settings` on `GET /api/v2/admin/markers/capabilities` reports
that the server honors the two settings; an older server stores them through
the generic settings endpoint but ignores them, so clients offer the switches
only when it is `true`.

`markers.detection_workers` sizes local detection: how many seasons or movies
the **Detect markers on this server** task analyzes at once, which also bounds
how many ffmpeg processes read audio and video. It defaults to `1` and accepts
1 to 64.
Detection mostly waits on reading each file's opening and closing minutes, so
a higher value finishes a large library sooner on fast storage, at the cost of
load that competes with playback. Analysis started from playback always has one
extra ffmpeg slot of its own. A change applies without a restart; extractions
already running finish first.

Replicas coordinate fetches with expiring database leases. File replacement or
rematching invalidates derived markers; a result fetched for the previous file
identity cannot overwrite the new one. Successful provider refreshes can correct
or withdraw that provider's existing ranges.

`POST /api/v2/admin/items/{id}/refresh-markers` explicitly refreshes an episode
or a movie from its configured sources; `movie_credits` on
`GET /api/v2/admin/markers/capabilities` reports that movies are accepted. In
`both` mode, eligible local detection fills missing intro and credits markers
of an episode, or missing credits of a movie, for the kinds the two detection
settings leave on.
`POST /api/v2/admin/items/{id}/redetect-markers`, which `redetect_markers` on
the same capabilities document reports, reruns local detection of an episode's
intro, credits, or both, or of a movie's credits; see
[admin-catalog-api.md](admin-catalog-api.md#episode-and-movie-marker-analysis).
The v1 refresh endpoint retains its local-only behavior, and it, the v1
re-detect endpoint, and v2 `redetect-intro` analyze episode intros only,
whatever the detection settings say.

## Operations

| Method | Path | Operation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v2/markers/files/{file_id}` | `getFileMarkers` |
| GET | `/api/v2/markers/items/{item_id}` | `getItemMarkers` |
| PUT | `/api/v2/markers/files/{file_id}` | `setFileMarkers` |
| PUT | `/api/v2/markers/items/{item_id}` | `setItemMarkers` |
| DELETE | `/api/v2/markers/files/{file_id}/{segment}` | `clearFileMarkerSegment` |

Item routes select the item's first accessible file, using episode files before
content files. Every success returns HTTP 200 with a string `file_id` and four
objects: `intro`, `credits`, `recap`, and `preview`. A segment with no marker is an
empty object. Present boundaries are `start_seconds` and `end_seconds`, measured
in source-file seconds. Provenance fields (`source`, `provider`, `confidence`,
`algorithm`, `detected_at`) are omitted when absent. Timestamps use the shared v2
instant format.

Responses also include `marker_segments`, an array of every effective marker
occurrence in source-time order. Each entry has `kind` (`intro`, `credits`,
`recap`, or `preview`), `start_seconds`, and `end_seconds`. The array is empty
when no markers exist. Several entries may have the same kind; clients must
treat them as separate ranges and must not skip the gaps between them. The
four singular objects remain available as compatibility projections. Files
with only legacy markers contribute those ranges to the collection.

The playback capability `marker_segments_v1` advertises collection support.
The same collection appears on each file version in v2 watch detail. Reads may
populate markers after access checks according to the configured provider mode;
provider failures preserve the existing readable marker state.

PUT accepts a partial update: omit a segment to leave it unchanged, send `null`
to clear it, or send an object to set it. For example:

```json
{"intro":{"end_seconds":48.5},"credits":null}
```

This sets intro from zero to 48.5 seconds, clears credits, and preserves recap and
preview. Intro and recap default a missing start to zero and require an end.
Credits and preview require a start and default a missing end to the known file
duration. Individual boundaries cannot be null. Unknown fields, negative or
nonfinite boundaries, and an end at or before the start are rejected. Existing
duration validation retains its one-second tolerance; an unknown duration cannot
supply a default end.

The existing manual fields address one kind at a time. Setting one replaces
that kind's occurrences with the supplied range; clearing it removes every
occurrence of that kind. Other kinds are unchanged. `marker_segments` is a
read-only projection, not a PUT field.

All supplied segments are validated before the shared writer commits the mixed
set/clear update and its audit rows in one transaction. Audit identity comes from
authenticated claims. Failed validation or audit insertion rolls back the update.
After commit, the service reloads the effective markers, publishes a notification,
and may contribute newly set segments through the existing provider service.

Writes advertise `non_retryable`. Database no-op detection and contribution
claims do not guarantee exactly-once external effects: notifications may repeat,
and a provider can accept a contribution before its response or local receipt is
lost. A failed response can therefore follow a successful save. Read the current
markers before deciding whether another user-directed update is needed.

The legacy v1 adapter shares the manual writer path and retains its wire format.
Jellyfin does not expose these manual editing routes. Its MediaSegments response
returns each occurrence separately, with credits represented as `Outro`.
The generated OpenAPI document is the authoritative v2 schema and error contract.
