## 1.0 release scope

The [1.0 milestone](https://siloserver.org/milestone/1.0/) covers movies and
series. Audiobooks, ebooks, and Audiobookshelf compatibility keep working as
they do today and are labeled **beta**: they are outside the 1.0 support
promise and will be replaced by a consolidated Books effort with no assigned
release date. The broader capabilities below include those beta
implementations, not a promise that every media type is supported in 1.0.
Existing library data is preserved when upgrading.

## What Silo does

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <strong>Play</strong><br><br>
      Direct play when possible, remux when needed, transcode otherwise, with
      VA-API, Quick Sync, and NVENC hardware acceleration.
    </td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <strong>Organize</strong><br><br>
      One catalog for films, series, audiobooks, ebooks, podcasts, and manga,
      matched through metadata plugins such as TMDB and TVDB.
    </td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <strong>Connect</strong><br><br>
      Use the included web app, or the Jellyfin/Emby-compatible API with clients
      such as <a href="https://vidhub.okaapps.com/what-does-vidhub-do/">VidHub</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/jarnedemeulemeester/findroid">Findroid</a>, and
      <a href="https://firecore.com/infuse">Infuse</a>. Client coverage varies.

      Start with one integrated server; split proxy and transcode roles across
      shared PostgreSQL and Redis when you need to.

  </tr>
</table>

## Quick start

Requires Docker Compose 2.24 or newer. The default stack runs Silo, PostgreSQL
with pgvector, and Redis.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Silo-Server/silo-server.git
cd silo-server
cp .env.example .env
chmod 600 .env
printf '\nPOSTGRES_PASSWORD=%s\nSECRET_KEY=%s\n' \
  "$(openssl rand -hex 24)" "$(openssl rand -base64 48)" >> .env
```

Set `MEDIA_ROOT` in `.env` to the absolute path of your media, then:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

Open <http://localhost:8090> and complete onboarding.

The [user manual](https://siloserver.org/docs) covers the rest, starting with
[installation](https://siloserver.org/docs/install): backing up `SECRET_KEY`,
storage, GPU acceleration, Meilisearch, external PostgreSQL and Redis,
transcode nodes, PostgreSQL tuning, backups, and updates.

## Builds and releases

Until the first release, default-branch images carry an ordered `build-N` tag
and a short commit SHA alongside `latest`. Build numbers order published images;
they are not release versions. [Release versioning](docs/release-versioning.md)
defines each tag and the SemVer contract.

## Documentation

- [User manual](https://siloserver.org/docs) — installing, configuring, and running Silo
- [Development guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) — source setup, builds, tests, migrations
- [Settings API](docs/settings-api.md), [Downloads API](docs/downloads-api.md), and [Apple Push Display Token](docs/notifications-push-api.md) — client contracts

## Community and contributions

Questions and discussion: [Discord](https://discord.gg/siloserver).
Bugs, install problems, and performance issues: the
[GitHub issue forms](https://github.com/Silo-Server/silo-server/issues/new/choose),
which ask for reproduction steps and raw logs.

Native clients are developed in
[`silo-apple`](https://github.com/Silo-Server/silo-apple) and
[`silo-android`](https://github.com/Silo-Server/silo-android). Client-visible
API, authentication, playback, or metadata changes should consider both.

Right now, the most helpful way to contribute is a clear, accurate issue. We
implement and review changes through our own workflow, and pull request volume
has outgrown what we can review carefully, so a good issue usually helps us
more than a pull request.

Pull requests are still welcome from contributors who've had one merged in a
Silo repository, or when a maintainer asks for one. We close other pull
requests without review. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) explains what makes
an issue useful.

## Supporting Silo

Silo is developed in spare time and funded out of pocket, and will stay free and
open source. [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/quick104) covers AI
development tooling (Claude, Codex), push-notification relay infrastructure, and
future project costs. Bug reports, code, and documentation help just as much.

Code review is supported by [Macroscope](https://macroscope.com) through its
open source program.
